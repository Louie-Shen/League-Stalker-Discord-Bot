# Discord League Tracker Bot
use `node index.js` to start app

Commands:
!ping: returns "Pong!"
!find [summoner name], [tag]: returns PUUID
!stalk [puuid]: returns if PUUID is in game or not

This is a discord bot I made that tracks when users that have been set to be tracked start a game of league of legends.
