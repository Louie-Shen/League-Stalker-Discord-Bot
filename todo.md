# Bugs to fix:
- [X] tracking only pings during first game potentially and no subsequent games
- [X] if a 502 bad gateway error, bot does not continue to track
- [X] only shows MATCHED game does not show ranked game ever, I want to specify game type
- [ ] update refresh timer to match api standards
- [ ] change ping feature to pinging two roles, one for if you want all gamemode pings and one for only ranked pings
